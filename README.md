# RulesðŸ“ƒ
- The project must work when opening [index.html](https://github.com/lingonsaft/hacktoberfest/blob/master/index.html).
- You are allowed to make pull requests that break the rules. We just won't merge it ;).
- Do NOT add any build steps e.g npm install (we want to keep this a simple static site).
- Do NOT remove Videos, Rules, FAQ, or any other helpful content.
- Styling/code can be pretty, ugly or stupid, big or small as long as it works.
- Add your name to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/airbornesd/airbornesd.github.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
- Try to keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts.
